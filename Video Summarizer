is an economically just the engine is just the principles you listen you learn engineering different contacts final True and businesses and understand the decisions that drive our economy okay so same principles you can think of for engineering classes but applied to people flies and that s why I m okay by Paul Samuelson in the s and s who wrote the fundamental textbook that because he was here and
